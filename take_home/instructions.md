### Please answer as much of this take home as you can in a maximum of 2 hours. Please return this assignment within 4 calendar days of receiving it.



## Part A - Customer Communication

Write a response to both of these customer prompts as if you were responding to an actual customer:

1. “Looking for API access. I would submit a domain name, looking for email address of founder or CEO. Is this Enrichment or Prospector? Please help me sign up for the right plan. Thanks, Dave”

2. “Reveal API was working correctly a month ago, however I noticed the number of company identifications seem to have dropped dramatically in the last week. Can your team please help take a look?



## Part B - Documentation
A major part of the Support Engineering role involves self-sufficiency and being able to troubleshoot answers that are (and sometimes are not) readily available. Many of the answers for the following questions can be found in: https://clearbit.com/docs, and some might not.

1. What is our non-streaming API rate limit?

2. Which requests count against a customers quota for the Enrichment API?

3. Which of these is a valid revenue range?
  * $1M-$10M
  * $1,000,000-$10,000,000
  * 1-10M
  * 1000000-10000000
  * All are valid
  * None are valid




## Part C - Code

1. Write a script that will replace all image tags on clearbit.com with a picture of your favorite dog.

2. Write a script that takes this list of company names, dedupes them, and runs against our name to domain api, returning the domains. Provide the before and after CSV.
